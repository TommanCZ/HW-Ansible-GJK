# HW-Ansible-GJK

This is my homework for my linux class.
The assignment was to create an Ansible yaml file with tasks to:
1) create a new user
2) add a public ssh key to the user
3) install a few useful packages (Yes, sl package is fundamental)

I could have used my Rasp. Pi for the project, but I decided to do it locally
(because sincerely I was to lazy to try to find it :/ ).

The cript uses pacman module (because I use Manjaro) so it will not work on any
other system that has a different package manager (basically any other system
that is not arch or arch-based)

Enjoy
